Mini display of 8 x 16 leds together with DHT11 as a simple Firebase Client to Get and Set data.

Another client on an Android phone is then used to add the value to the database, indirectly controlling the display of the Led Matrix.

## Hardware
The hardware used in this project is the ESP8266 Node MCU v3 from AZ Delivery: https://www.az-delivery.de/en/products/nodemcu-lolin-v3-modul-mit-esp8266

This is connected to low cost DHT11 sensor.

This is also connected to two sets of MAX7219 from ICStation: http://www.icstation.com/icstation-max7219-light-lamp-display-matrix-module-panel-kits-p-2609.html this results in the 8 x 16 leds array.

The hardware is cased with simple lego cases to protect and give style to the ESP boards 😊
